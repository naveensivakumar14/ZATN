#  Class 7 : 21-11-2024: Creating Routes Using Express JS

Introduction to Express JS
Understanding the Express.js framework and its advantages for building web applications.
Setting up and defining routes for handling various HTTP methods (GET, POST, etc.).
We are implementing dynamic routing to handle parameters and queries.
Building a simple application with multiple API endpoints using Express.js.

#  Class 8 : 25-11-2024: CRUD get routes, Thunder client testing using express js
Understanding CRUD Operations: Learned about creating GET routes in Express.js to retrieve data from the server.
Dynamic Route Parameters: We explored handling dynamic and query-based routes for better data filtering.
Thunder Client Testing: Practised testing APIs using Thunder Client to validate GET route responses.
Error Handling: Implemented proper error handling techniques for invalid or missing data requests in Express.js.

# Class 9: 26-11-2024: CRUD Operations and Thunder Client Testing in Express.js
CRUD Operations Overview: Gained a comprehensive understanding of implementing all CRUD operations (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) in Express.js.
POST Route for Data Creation: Learned to set up POST routes to add new data and handle JSON request payloads in Express.js.
PUT Route for Data Updates: Created PUT routes to update existing data by ID or specific criteria.
DELETE Route for Data Deletion: Explored the DELETE route to remove data and implement checks for non-existent resources safely.
Thunder Client for API Testing: Validated CRUD operations using Thunder Client and analyzed API responses for success and error cases.

# Class 10: 27-11-2024: To-do CRUD Express JS
Creating a To-Do List with Express.js:
Developed a basic To-Do list application backend using Express.js.
CRUD Operations Integration: Implemented Create, Read, Update, and Delete functionalities for managing To-Do tasks.
Working with data.json: I learned how to use a data.json file as a local database to store and manipulate To-Do list data.
Dynamic Routes for To-Do Management: Created routes for task-specific operations, such as fetching, updating, or deleting tasks by ID.
Data Persistence with JSON: Explored reading from and writing to the data.json file to ensure task data persists between requests.

# Class 11: 28-11-2024 : Promises and CRUD operations

Introduction to Promises: Gained an understanding of JavaScript Promises, including how to handle asynchronous operations effectively.
Promise States and Methods: Explored the states of Promises (Pending, Fulfilled, Rejected) and methods like then(), catch(), and finally() for chaining and error handling.
Integrating Promises with CRUD: Used Promises to handle asynchronous file operations (e.g., reading and writing to data.json) while building a To-Do list application.
Improving CRUD Functionality: Enhanced To-Do list CRUD operations by ensuring non-blocking code execution using Promises.
Error Handling with Promises: Handling errors gracefully during Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations using catch() blocks.

# Class 12: 29-11-2024: MonogoDB CRUD and Database connectivity using Express JS

Connecting MongoDB with Express.js: I learned how to establish a connection between an Express.js application and a MongoDB database using the Mongoose library.
Defining Schemas and Models: I explored creating MongoDB schemas and models to define the structure of database documents for CRUD operations.
Implementing MongoDB CRUD: Built Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) functionalities to interact with MongoDB collections.
Data Validation and Middleware: Used Mongoose validation and middleware to ensure data integrity during CRUD operations.
